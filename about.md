## About Tiffy

Tiffy is a travel planning freak, formerly an Asia Pacific finance manager and currently a digital marketing ninja. Despite being a nervous flyer with plane jolts sending chills down her spine, Tiffy’s wanderlust has led her to visit Japan for 6 times (and counting). Her favorite cities are Kyoto and Tokyo and would choose to visit Japan over Paris in a heartbeat!
